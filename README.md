# Text-Mining-and-Search---Amazon-Fine-Foods-Review

Authors: Merlo Fabrizio and Sanvito Simone

The aim of this project is to perform some NLP tasks on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews
dataset, which consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.
The tasks performed on this dataset are text pre-processing, text representation, text
clustering and text summarization. The models used for text clustering are k-means,
hierarchical clustering, OPTICS, DBSCAN and Birch; for text summarization, there have been
used models like TextRank, Txtai, T5, BART and Seq2Seq.
Both tasks are presented with relative evaluation metrics.
